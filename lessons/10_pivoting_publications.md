[Science submission instructions](https://www.sciencemag.org/authors/instructions-preparing-initial-manuscript)

- The figure’s title should be at the beginning of the figure legend, not in the figure itself
- **Panels should be set close to each other, and common axis labels should not be repeated.**
- Use scale bars in place of, or in addition to, magnifications. Do not use minor tick marks in scales or grid lines. Avoid using y-axis labels on the right that repeat those on the left.
- Avoid using red and green together. Color blind individuals will not be able read the figure.
- **Please do not use colors that are close in hue to identify different parts of a figure.**
- Avoid using grayscale.
- Use white type and scale bars over darker areas of images.
- Units should be metric and follow SI convention.
- **Use a sans-serif font whenever possible (we prefer Helvetica).**
- Capitalize the first letter in a label only, not every word (and proper nouns, of course).
- **Variables are always set in italics or as plain Greek letters (e.g., P, T, m). The rest of the text in the figure should be plain or bold text.**
- Type on top of color in a color figure should be in bold face. Avoid using color type
- **Use capital letters for part labels in multipart figures – A, B, C, etc. These should be 9 pt and bold in the final figure. When possible, place part labels at the upper left-hand corner of each figure part; if a part is an image, set labels inside the perimeter so as not to waste space. (not exactly sure how to do this)**

## Talk about altering personal_template() and personal_palette() to adhere to the requirements of the journal. 
  - We can change the personal_theme() to:
    - change all font to Helvetica
  - Change palette to be color-blind friendly and of different hues (which we already did, so we could just discuss this)
  - Show how we could do the other bold changes above - plain text adheres to our current figures, I think, but should double-check
